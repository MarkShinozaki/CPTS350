## [Homework 1](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS350-Design-AnalysisOfAlgorithms/tree/Homeworks/Homework%201)

### Requirements:

### Language Problem Mapping:
Link the concept of a problem being a language, as learned in Cpts 317, to Cpts 350. For example, consider a graph and determine whether it is connected. You must identify the languages corresponding to several problems:

- **Problem 1:** Given a number `n` and two primes `p` and `q`, is `n = p * q`?
- **Problem 2:** Given a number `n`, is `n = p * q` for some primes `p` and `q`?
- **Problem 3:** Given a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) `A` and a word `w`, does `A` accept `w`?
- **Problem 4:** Given an NFA `A`, is there a word `w` such that `A` accepts `w`?

### Big-O Notation Proofs:
Prove why specific functions fit within Big-O notation for certain bounds. For instance, show that:

- The function `2n^3 − 18n` is `O(n^3)`, `O(n^4)`, but not `O(n^2 log n)`.
- The function `3n^2 * 2^(2n)` is `2^O(n)`.

### Real-World Problem and Algorithm Design:
Design an algorithm to compute a similarity metric between two protein molecules based on their 3D structures. The problem requires:

- Describing how such an algorithm could help in drug development.
- Choosing a data structure to represent protein molecules.
- Defining and sketching two similarity metrics and associated algorithms to compute these metrics.

### Topics:
- Language theory and problem encoding.
- Big-O notation and complexity analysis.
- Bioinformatics and algorithm design for real-world applications.
- Protein structure analysis and data representation.

### Summary:
This assignment challenges students to link concepts from language theory to problem-solving in algorithm analysis. It explores the theoretical aspects of Big-O notation and pushes students to design algorithms for complex real-world problems, specifically in bioinformatics. Students need to think critically about data representation and algorithm efficiency, particularly in the context of protein molecule similarity, with a focus on applications in drug development.

## [Homework 1 Prime (Bonus Problem)](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS350-Design-AnalysisOfAlgorithms/blob/Homeworks/Homework%203/homework1prime.pdf)

### Requirements:

1. **Input Size and Complexity:**
   - The problem emphasizes understanding how input size affects computational complexity. Students must correctly determine input sizes and understand how they impact the performance of algorithms.

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - The problem also requires students to distinguish between read-only memory and additional memory required by an algorithm, particularly in the context of space complexity.

3. **Blum’s Speedup Theorem:**
   - The core of the problem is related to Blum’s speedup theorem, which states that for any algorithm, it is possible to create a faster algorithm that performs better on almost all inputs. The problem provides an example of speeding up a multiplication algorithm by processing digits two at a time rather than one at a time.

### Summary:
The bonus problem in Homework 1 is a theoretical exploration of algorithm optimization, focusing on Blum’s speedup theorem. Students are required to demonstrate their understanding of input size, memory usage, and how to speed up algorithms by processing more significant chunks of data at once. This problem highlights the importance of theoretical computer science in practical algorithm design.

### Requirements:

### 1. Sorting Problem (Purple-Haired Babies Sorting Algorithm):
- The first problem involves designing an efficient algorithm to sort an array of items based on specific criteria, in this case, sorting babies by hair color (purple, brown, black) using a one-pass, in-place, and linear time approach.
